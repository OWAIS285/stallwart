"""Record a replay demo: an AI scammer phones the real decoy pipeline and the two actually talk to each other.

The scammer is a Gemini Flash script-writer that reads what the decoy just said and answers it, following the usual
digital-arrest playbook (hook, fear, isolation, payment demand, deadline). Its lines are spoken with Gemini TTS and
streamed to /ws/call as microphone audio, exactly like a browser would. Everything the backend emits (transcripts,
details, classification, latency) is saved next to the audio. English calls are English on both sides and Hindi calls
are Hindi on both sides.

The replay audio is then assembled turn by turn from the two real streams: each side is played in full, one after the
other, with short fixed pauses, so voices never overlap and there is no dead air while the live model connects. Event
times are remapped onto that timeline so the transcript and dashboard stay in step with the sound. The assembled
replay must land between --min-sec and --max-sec; otherwise the last exchanges are dropped or the call is re-recorded.

    python scripts/make_replay.py --lang english     # replay-en  (local backend on :8080)
    python scripts/make_replay.py --lang hindi       # replay-hi  (start the backend with LANGUAGE_CODE=hi-IN)

Needs Application Default Credentials (the same ones the backend uses). All names, numbers and IDs are fictional.

Sound like a real Indian call-centre scammer: brisk, confident, intimidating but polite, using 'sir' (or the natural

the script on, the way a real person on a call would. Never repeat a sentence you already said.

- Whenever you need one of these facts write the token exactly as shown and nothing else for it: {NAME} {AGENCY}
