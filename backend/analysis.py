The CALLER is an unknown person. Most callers are ordinary (a wrong number, family, a genuine bank, lender, insurer,

Only the CALLER's words count as evidence. Do not judge by topic: genuine banks and lenders also call about loans,
KYC, accounts, cards and Aadhaar. A name, city, phone number, bank name or account number is never a red flag by
itself, and neither is one word such as 'bank', 'UPI' or 'police'. Report only behaviour the caller actually showed,
never what they might do later. A false scam alert on a genuine caller is a serious error.
Return JSON with:

  no scam pattern at all, undetermined when there is too little to tell. This is a label for the topic, not a verdict.

- stage: one of {', '.join(STAGES)} (use hook if nothing risky has happened yet)
